## Summary
This is a Chrome extension built to make it easy to find gifts for those you love. Log in to Google. Surf Amazon, and then find a cool gift for that one special friend. If there's one that you would think you want to buy, you can add that gift to your wishlist for that friend. Later, if you choose to buy that gift, you can manage your bought gifts and balance your budget in your gift hub on the [**giftn** web app](https://github.com/jordantsanz/giftn-webapp). Shopping made easy!

## Services
This extension uses Google authentication and connects to [**giftn's** REST API](https://github.com/catherinedparnell/giftn-api) where it engages with Google Cloud Firestore database. It uses the [Rainforest API](https://rainforestapi.com/docs/product-data-api/overview) to get corresponding Amazon data on particular products.
